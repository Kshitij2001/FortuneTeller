# FortuneTeller
This project involves two smart contracts, FortuneTeller.sol and FortuneSeeker.sol, that interact with each other on the Avalanche Fuji testnet (or any EVM network). FortuneTeller.sol uses Chainlinkâ€™s Verifiable Random Function (VRF) to generate a provably random number, which is then used to select a fortune from an array.
